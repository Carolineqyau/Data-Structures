# Data Structures

Here are some programs I wrote in Python 3 that handles data structures in best case run time.
1. [Linked Lists](linkedLists/)
2. [Recursive Functions](recursiveFunctions/)
3. [Sorting Functions](sortingFunctions/)
4. [Binary Heap, building heap in O(nlogn) time](binaryHeap-buildHeap-O(nlogn))
